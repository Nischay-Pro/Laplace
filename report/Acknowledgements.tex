\section*{Acknowledgements}
Firstly, I would like to thank my parents and brother for supporting me in every way possible during my stay in Sweden. I would like to thank my supervisor Niklas Andersson for giving me an opportunity to work on this thesis. My understanding of numerical methods for fluid dynamics and programming vastly improved during the past year through this thesis. I am very grateful to him for that. I would also like to thank Ragnar LÃ¡russon and Huadong Yao for helping me out with CALC++. Finally, I want to thank all my friends here in Gothenburg and back home.
